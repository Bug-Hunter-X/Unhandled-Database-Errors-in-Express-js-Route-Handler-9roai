# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  missing or insufficient error handling in route handlers that interact with databases or external services.  The example showcases a route that fetches user data; however, it fails to gracefully handle potential database errors, resulting in unhelpful 500 errors.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that retrieves user data from a database (simulated here).  Crucially, it lacks robust error handling for scenarios where the database operation fails.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  It includes comprehensive error handling to catch potential database errors and respond with appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages, improving user experience and simplifying debugging.
